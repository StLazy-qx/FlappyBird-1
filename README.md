Implement a Flappy Bird-like runner with the following changes:
Obstacles no longer appear, instead, enemies appear on the right side of the screen, periodically shooting bullets horizontally (to the left).
The player can also shoot by pressing a separate key. The bullet will be directed where the player is looking at the moment of the shot.
Enemy bullets can destroy the player, and the player's bullets destroy enemies.
The character control remains similar to Flappy Bird.
